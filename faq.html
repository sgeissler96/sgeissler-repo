                    <h4>What do you need to do when you are sick / show symptoms of coronavirus?</h4>
                    <p>Stay home and contact your teacher via Teams/mail. <br> Call 0800 - 1202 to make an appointment at a test location nearby. The number is free of charge and can be reached seven days a week from 08.00 to 20.00 hours. You can also request a test online via <a href="www.rijksoverheid.nl/coronatest">www.rijksoverheid.nl/coronatest</a> (for this you need a DigiD). Before making the appointments, we will briefly ask you a number of questions about the complaints. When making the appointment a BSN-number will be asked for identification. Keep this number at hand when making the appointment and make a list of your contacts from 2 days before you became ill. After making the appointment they will give you the time and place where the test will be taken. The aim is to take the test as soon as possible, in principle the next day. The result comes 24-48 hours later.</p>
