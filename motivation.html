                                    <p>Motivation is the word derived from the word ’motive’ which means
                                        needs, desires, wants or drives within the individuals. It is
                                        the process of
                                        stimulating people to actions to accomplish the goals. In the
                                        work goal context
                                        the psychological factors stimulating the people’s behaviour can
                                        be -

                                        One of the most important functions of management is to create
                                        willingness
                                        amongst the employees to perform in the best of their abilities.
                                        Therefore the
                                        role of a leader is to arouse interest in performance of
                                        employees in their
                                        jobs. The process of motivation consists of three stages:-
                                    </p>
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>A felt need or drive</li>
                                        <li>A stimulus in which needs have to be aroused</li>
                                        <li>When needs are satisfied, the satisfaction or accomplishment
                                            of goals.</li>
                                    </ul>
                                    <p>
                                        Therefore, we can say that motivation is a psychological
                                        phenomenon which means
                                        needs and wants of the individuals have to be tackled by framing
                                        an incentive
                                        plan.

                                </p>

                                        The incentive theory of motivation suggests that people are
                                        motivated by a drive for incentives and reinforcement. It also
                                        proposes that people behave in a way that they believe will
                                        result
                                        in a reward and avoid actions that may entail punishment.

                                        Employees might behave differently in similar situations
                                        depending
                                        on the incentives available. For example, an employee might work
                                        harder on a project to earn a good review or to avoid a poor
                                        review
                                        than if they don’t receive a review at all. Their motivation is
                                        their desire to receive a reward or avoid punishment via a
                                        performance review at the end of the project.
                                        <br>
                                        The value of the same incentive may change depending on the time
                                        and
                                        circumstance. People may value similar incentives differently.
                                        Psychological and social factors can have a role in determining
                                        which people have a motivation for different incentives.
                                        Incentives
                                        only work as motivational tools if individuals place value on
                                        the
                                        reward they will receive for their actions.

                                        Incentives in the workplace, as in other facets of life, can
                                        also be
                                        positive or negative:

                                        <li>Positive incentives. Provide positive assurance that an

                                            doing their work well. Examples of positive incentives
                                            include recognition, promotions, raises and so forth.

                Test from 123test.nl:
                <p class="mb-4">You are to a reasonable degree intrinsically motivated and little extrinsically
                    motivated. The fact
                    that you are reasonably intrinsically motivated means that you enjoy studying. But you don't like it
                    very much either. The fact that you are not extrinsically motivated means that you don't care what
                    you can achieve with your studies: a diploma, money, status or the recognition of the people you
                    love. Your interests are more important to you.
                </p>
                My opinion about the test:
                <p>I have always thought that I was ltittle intrinsically motivated and that I needed that the extrinsic
                    motivation to guide me along the way.
                    I do agree with the second sentence, I don't mind studying, and I have actually come to somewhat
                    like it since starting this study programme.
                    I do care what about what I can achieve with my studies, I want to start working at a school when I
                    finish this programme in a few years.
                    Altough I don't really care about money, status or the recognition of others. In those cases my
                    interestsare indeed more important to me.

                <strong>You gave the most points to the role: Social contacts (21 points)</strong>
                <p>People with this drive attach great value to social contacts. Companionship and friendship are
                    important reasons for having a job. The separation between work and private life is less strict for
                    them. When making career choices, one will therefore quickly be guided by the question of whether
                    one meets or has enough colleagues. Whether one likes the work depends on the extent to which one
                    can work together or is among the people.
                </p>
                <strong>After that you gave the most points: Standards and values (18 points)</strong>
                <p>The main motivation of someone with this career anchor is to contribute to a greater whole. Based on
                    personal values and norms one wants to 'improve the world' or make a meaningful contribution to
                    society.
                    Often one makes one's own interests subordinate to this. The main goal is to have the feeling that
                    one
                    is helping others.
                </p>
                <p>I have worked at McDonald's for 4 and a half years, the main reason that I didn't quit earlier is
                    because of the great social contacts that I built there. I really like having a closebond with my
                    colleagues. Also jobs that require social interaction is a very important requirment for me.
                </p>
                <p>Having tried to instill standards and norms into children for about 4 years has really had a postive
                    effect on me.
                    I try to live a life with what I believe are good standards and norms and would like to see the same
                    from a future workplace.
                </p>
                <strong>You gave the least number of points to: Status (3 points)</strong>
                <p>
                    Impress or having prestige is the important motive. People like to be part of a privileged group.
                    They like to receive formal recognition for their achievements. One loves it when others look up to
                    them. One has no problem with external status symbols such as titles or official recognition.
                    Earning money or obtaining power is more often just a means to obtaining status than an end in
                    itself.
                </p>
                <p>I have never really cared to be part of a privileged group or that have prestige and people looking
                    up to me.
                    This is not something that I crave for and it would not motivate me at future workplaces.

                <p>All throughout my life I've had moments where I struggeled to find motivation. I've personally always
                    felt that I need extrinsic motivation to keep me focussed on (school)work. Although at this moment
                    in this time, I feel like I'm able to keep myself motivated.</p>
